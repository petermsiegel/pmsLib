   ∆HERE:   hereDoc ← ∆HERE    [ ⍝ ⍠0 ]
            A fast here-document utility, with only simple "option":  ⍝ ⍠0
            ∘ Default or ⍠1
              The "here" doc is terminated by a line with is neither a comment nor a blank line. 
            ∘ With ⍠0
              The "here" doc is terminated by any non-comment line, including a blank line.
            ∘ Comment lines with a prefix ⍝⍝ are ignored.
            ∘ Other comment lines are kept, but the symbol ⍝ and preceding blanks are discarded.
            Returns a vector of character strings (possibly of length 0).
   ⍙HERE:   hereDoc ← ⍙HERE 
            Same as ∆HERE with no "options."
            The fastest here-doc utility. Assumes all contiguous comment or blank lines after the ⍙HERE call
            are here-document lines. Those with ⍝⍝ prefix are ignored. Otherwise The ⍝ comment prefix is removed.
            Returns a vector of character strings (possibly of length 0).
   ∆HEREX:   hereDoc ← ∆HEREX [⍝ <anytext>  ⍠ keywords]
         keywords:
             BLanks | NOBLanks   Do uncommented blank lines end the ∆HERE doc?
             MUltiple | SIngle   Do we return multiple strings (vector of vectors) or a single string (char vector)?
                                 If SIngle, use CR option by default (q.v.).
             CR | LF             Sets SIngle (above) and...
                                 ... uses the specified char (CR or LF) as the line separator (CR by default).
             DEbug, DBG          Shows debug info.
         Returns an APL "Here Document" entered as a series of comments following the ∆HERE function.
         The ∆HERE document ends when a non-comment line is seen, one not of the form '^\h*⍝'
                NoBlanks: including a blank line;
                BLANKS: excluding blank lines '^\h*$', which are treated as '⍝ '.
         ∘ Comment lines of the form '^\h*⍝ ' are kept;
         ∘ Comment lines of the form '^\h*⍝[^⍝] are ignored, but don't end the ∆HERE document.
  
   Returns:
         [MULTIPLE* option] a vector of character vectors of ∆HERE-doc lines following the ∆HERE call.
         [SINGLE option] a single vector string with CR (default) or NL (option) <<separating>> lines.
         For each line returned, the prefix '^\h*⍝' is removed (leading blanks, comment symbol).
         ------------
         * MULTIPLE is the default.
   Options:
        ∆HEREX is a niladic function. Options are within a comment on the same function line as the ∆HEREX.
        Option keywords on the ∆HERE function line are between the ⍠ and the first ⍝ or end of line of the 
        ∆HEREX comment, e.g. field 1 in this regex:
             ⍝[^⍠]*⍠([^⍝]*) 
        e.g. this example treats empty lines after the ∆HERE as blank comment lines,
             and returns multiple lines using the carriage return.

  ∘ Keyword Options, Associated Variables, and Actions
    Keyword    Abbrev Def  Options←val  Description
    BLANKS     BL          oBlanks←1    Treat empty lines as comment lines '⍝ ',
                                        so only code lines end a ∆HERE doc
    NOBLANKS   NOBL   Y    oBlanks←0    Treat empty lines as if APL code, ending a ∆HERE sequence.
    MULTIPLE   MU     Y    oMulti←1     If multiple lines, return as vec of vec strings
    SINGLE     SI          oMulti←0     If multiple lines, return as single vector with CR as line separator
    LF         LF          lineEnd←⎕UCS 10   (linefeed). Sets SINGLE, i.e. oMulti←0
    CR         CR     Y    lineEnd←⎕UCS 13   (carriage return).  Sets SINGLE, i.e. oMulti←0.
    DEBUG      DEB    N    oDebug←1     Start debug (verbose) mode
               DBG         oDebug←1      Alternative to DEB/UG
    anything else          **ignore**
  
   The default keywords are:  ⍝ ⍠ MULTI  NOBLANKS   -- Create vector of vector and end the ∆HERE doc at first non-comment
   A common alternative is:   ⍝ ⍠ CR BL             -- Create a char string with lines separated by CR carriage return.
                                                       End ∆HERE doc at first code line (non-comment, non-blank line).
  
   If SINGLE is specified, CR is the default line separator.
   The default options are:       oMulti←1 ⋄ oBlanks←0 ⋄ lineEnd←⎕UCS 13
  
    Here document example
        myHtml←∆HERE     ⍝ Tolerate blank lines ⍠ BL
        ⍝ <!DOCTYPE HTML>
        ⍝ <html>
        ⍝⍝ Next line is blank.    <-- This line is ignored because of '⍝⍝'.
                                  <-- Blank line would end the HERE doc without 'SPACES' option.
        ⍝ <head>
        ⍝ <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
                                  <-- Ditto
        <style>
        etc.
   BUGS:   The calling function must be an unlocked fn or op.
